**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the discussion of hazards that electric poles and underground structures present for individuals and the community at large. Because I had previously had only a basic understanding of electric structure, it was most interesting to learn about the many ways that underground and overhead structures can result in dangers. Not only does this include equipment failures, but unexpected and random variables such as car crashes, animals, sudden winds, and nearby vegetation complicate the concerns further. Preventive measures and care taken to prevent incidents are diverse and extensive at SDG&E.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I would like to further pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is whether or not various aspects of a structure's danger can be assessed through a photo. By exploring aspects such as: what kind of vegetation is growing around the pole/structure and how close, how close is the structure to the street, how worn/old does the structure appear, and hwat other hazards may be around the structure. Investigating these aspects through computer vision presents promising use cases.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is collection of an even greater number of images for fine-tuning of the model. Because image collection through Google Street View in large part was manual, this limited the number of images that our section could collect as a whole. However, if everyone had been able to collect more images, this may have improved the model's performance in recognizing underground and overhead structures.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Other techniques I would be interested in using in my project is user interaction. While optimizing models to identify poles and underground structures are effective, the use of computer vision can be maximized by creating interfaces where users and people out in public may be able to report and take a picture of different structures. By incorporating some form of user interaction into this project, there appears to be potential in identifying hazards more quickly.
